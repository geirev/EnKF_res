# EnKFres
EnKF for ECLIPSE
Fortran 90 code for running EnKF with ECLIPSE


To install and compile:

Define a case directory where you will compile the code, maybe next to a rundirectory for your
particular ECLIPSE model, since the setup is dependent on the ECLIPSE model.
Then follow instructions in inst.sh
