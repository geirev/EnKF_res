The simulation menu allows the user to set the
start and final data time for the experiment
and launch the simulaiton.  It is possible stop
and restart the simulation at arbitrary data times
as long as the restart file exists.

Just change the parameters to your need and
launch the simulation by typing go and return.

Some special flags are available: 
  c: allows the user to use different version
     of the EnKF analysis scheme. The version is
     defined by a 2-digit number.  The first digit
     is 1 or 2, where 1 denote the traditional EnKF
     analysis scheme and 2 denote the SQRT scheme.
     The second number is 1, 2, or 3 and defines the
     inversion algorithm used for the C=SS' + (N-1)R
     matrix.   1 is a standard pseudo inverse using 
     an eigen value decomposition as in the old analysis2
     and analysis4c,  2 is the subspace pseudo inversion 
     used in analysis5c and 3 denote the subspace pseudo
     inversion used in analysis6c where C=SS'+EE'. 
     Thus, these alternative pseudo inversions can now
     also be used with the traditional EnKF scheme.

     For comparison of codes we still retain the old
     options but these calls old routines and are no longer
     maintained.

       (2)  is the standard EnKF with perturbation
            of measurements,
       (4c) is the standard SQRT EnKF with full rank
            observation matrices.
       (5c) is standard SQRT EnKF with full rank
            observation covariance matrices but
            more effiecient computation algorithm
            with large data sets.
       (6c) is SQRT EnKF with low rank observation
            covariance matrix.

   d: allows for the run of a pure ensemble integration
      without updates from measurements.  It is used
      for a spinup simulation when no data are available,
      or for producing a prior ensemble simulation.
   
   e: skips the ensemble integration and proceeds
      directly to next analysis update.  This is
      useful if the update scheme is used repeatedly
      for testing or if the analysis failed and
      one wants to retry the computation with e.g. 
      some modified observations or analysis scheme.

   f: Only used for debugging. Exits after submitting
      ensemble.

   g: Ensemble integration without updates from measurements.
      Used to study statisics of pure ensemble runs.
   
   i: Includes perturbations of production data rates.
      Currently only used well is controlled by either one of
      RESV, ORAT, WRAT, GRAT or LRAT.   The magnitude of
      the random white perturbations is given in percentage
      of the rate value.

   j and k:  If one or several members fail these can be rerun
      independently by setting the first and last memeber to integrate.
      This is also useful if one whish to run just a few members
      to verfy that the system is working correctly.  Note that
      the first and last member is automatically reset to 1 and nrens.
