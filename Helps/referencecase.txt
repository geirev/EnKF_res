Sets up the refdir catalog with all files needed
to run a referece simulation, and then submits
the reference run.   This is considered as a
base simulation where the poro/perm priors from
the Prior directory is used.

Note that for synthetic experiments it is possible
to run the reference case with perturbed rates
simulating an uncertatinty in the model. This
is done by first activating the perturbed rates
flag under the ensemble integration meny.
