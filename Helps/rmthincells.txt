To avoid convergence problems, small or thin cells should be removed.  This cannot be
based on porevolume information, as is normally done, since the porevolume will then
vary between ensemble members, and different number of active cells will then be present
in each member.  The following alternative procedure removes cells based on the cell
thickness, only.

Before the referance case is submitted, run (a) to modify ECLIPSE_orig.DATA and SCHEDULE_orig.INC
to produce unformatted gridfiles ELCIPSE.GRID and ECLIPSE.EGRID and only integrate for one time step.
Then run option (b) to run the refcase, followed by option (c) to produce the final "remove.mod" file
which consists one line for each cell to remove.

This file needs to be placed in an include directory and then properly included in the
ECLIPSE_orig.DATA file.     

Remember:
   The reference case must be rerun.
   The new number of active gridpoints must updated in the mod_dimension.F90 file.
   The code must be recompiled.
