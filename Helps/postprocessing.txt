Following the reference simulation, the outputs
of the reference simulation are processed:

  a The mask.uf file must be regenerated if there
    are any chances that the active grid cells 
    as defined by ACTNUM has been changed. 
    The mask.uf file is normally read or generated
    at the start of the program.

  b The history production data are extracted
    and the file observations.dat is generated.

  c The outputs of the simulation is converted to
    the ensemble format for simple future reference,
    processing and plotting.  
    
    In case of problems in the processing the output
    of the interface routine is written to
    interface.log, and you will normally be able
    to identify the cause of the problem at the
    end of this file.   Further, the parameters
    used by the interface routine is stored in the
    interface.in file and you can rerun inteface 
    with these parameters using the I option in the
    main menu.
