-------------------------------------------------
The very first step is to install and compile the
source code.  The required steps involve:
 - definition of grid dimensions in LSOURCE/mod_dimensions.F90
 - optional redefinition of model state in LSOURCE/mod_states.F90
 - specification of statistics in the iniens program.
 - set correct architecture in the Code/update.sh script
 - set correct define statement in the Code/MODEL.CPP file
 - run update.sh in the Code directory

This compiles the whole code and places binaries in Code/bin.

 Note that the code should be recompiled after the 
 "Update interface program" script has been run.
