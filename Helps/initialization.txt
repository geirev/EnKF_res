-------------------------------------------------
Initialization of ensemble is normally done using
a version of the iniens program.  It uses files
from the Refence simulation and creates an initial
ensemble file with realizations of PORO, PERMX
and PERMZ.  In addition it generates an initial 
ensemble for the static fields.

If facies is true there is also a conditioning 
on log observations stored in "logmes.dat".
Thus it is not required to run the conditioning step.
