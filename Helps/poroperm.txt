Definition of priors in real field experiments:

PORO.INC, PERMX.INC, PERMZ.INC

You need to place the original poro and perm files
as included in your model in the Prior directory,
and renamed as PORO.ORIG, PERMX.ORIG and PERMZ.ORIG.
Also remember to remove the keyword in the files
which should only contain numbers.

In the menu you will update the poro and perm files
to a formatted version that fits the system.  
In this case the .ORIG files are read and written
in formatted form to .INC files.


MULTFLT.INC
If you are estimating fault multipliers by defining
the MULTFLT define statement, you also need to 
install a file MULTFLT.INC in the prior directory.

MULTZ.INC
If you are estimating vertical multipliers by defining
the MULTZ define statement, you also need to 
install a file MULTZ.INC in the prior directory.

EQUIL.INC
If you specify uncertainty in the initial contacts
through the EQUIL define statement, you also need
to install a file EQUIL.INC in the prior directory.


Note that these files should also be included at
the appropriate locations in the ECLIPSE_orig.DATA
file.

-------------------------------------------------
Note that in simulated experiments it is also 
possible to generate a new random prior, but 
this requires the reference simulation to be 
run first as well as the updating of the iniens
program.  In this case iniens writes random
priors to the .INC files.
