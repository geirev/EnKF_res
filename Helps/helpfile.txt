Help file for EnKF-Eclipse run script!

This menu includes the steps needed to perform an
assimilation experiment using EnKF with Eclipse.

Normally one would need to carry out the steps
in the menu in the order they are listed.
Steps 1-9 conserns the initialization of the 
experiment, while step 10 provides a menu for
the actual integration and assimilation.

Before an experiment is started there are some
parameters which must be set to fit the 
present implementation and application.
These are listed by the 0 option in the menu.

A specific help information for each option
is provided by pressing e.g., h1 for help on
option 1.
