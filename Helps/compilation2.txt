-------------------------------------------------
The very first step is to install and compile the
source code.  The required steps involve:
 - definition of grid dimensions in mod_dimensions.F90
 - optional redefinition of model state in mod_states.F90
 - specification of initial ensemble statistics in m_statistics.F90
 - set correct define statements in the Code/MODEL.CPP file
 - copy correct makefile.arch to makefile
 - Update target name and install directory
 - make new (to update source.files and depends.file)
 - make     (to compile program)
 - make install (to install binary in selected directory)


 Note that the code should be recompiled after the 
 - Update interface option  has been run since this updates the include
   files.
