Diagostics and plotting:

The EnKF produces a set of ensemble[AFS]????.uf files
containing all the ensemble members at each report step.

These are large files used for restart and computation of
diagnostics, and should not normally be kept.

The ensstat program is run on each of the ensemble files
and computes diagnostic output, i.e., ensemble averages,
ensemble variance and ensemble standard deviation.

These diagnostics are stored in Eclipse standard format
in the Diag directory.  Here they can be visualized using
standard Eclipse compatible software such as flowiz for
the spatial fields and s3graph or grap for the time series
stored in summary files.  Note that static variables
are included as time dependent variable since these are
updated during the assimilation and therefore change in time.

In addition the diagnostics is also stored in the Ensstat
directory in ensemble format.   Information can be
extracted from these fiels using either the tecpost3D
program which generate 3D information in files readable
by the commerical Tecplot program from Amtec.   Further,
the prodhist program can be used to extract time series
of the production history from the refcase and the 
files in the Ensstat directory.

In principle: for quick plots and easy reference the
Diag files allows for quick plotting etc.  However,
for making more advanced graphics the Tecplot files
gives larger flexibility, in particular for the timeseries.
