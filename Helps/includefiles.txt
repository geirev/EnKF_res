-------------------------------------------------
The interface between eclipse restart files and 
the EnKF requires the declaration of all variables
included in the eclipse restart file.   The 
number of variables changes substantially dependent
on the acutal model used and output parameters
defined in the data file.   Thus an automatic
generation of the interface program is helpful
and eliminates the possibility of introducing 
human errors.   

First generate the file of all eclipse restart 
variables from the reference simulation.

The generate the files needed in the interface
program.

The run the update script in ../Code.
