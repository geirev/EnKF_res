-------------------------------------------------
A file SCHEDULE_orig.INC is holding the basic
schedule information and in particular all
the WCONHIST and WCONPROD keywords in between
DATES statements.   To be able to restart
and run simulation between different DATA times
the SCHEDULE_orig.INC includes lines like
--END0012
at the end of each DATES statement, where 0012
in this case refers to DATES statement number 12
where restart file ECLIPSE.F0012 is saved.

The SCHEDULE_orig.INC file is automatically
generated from the menu and reads the original
schedule file used by your ECLIPSE model.
